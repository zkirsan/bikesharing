## Overview of the Analysis

The project's goal is to create visualizations by using the tableau. The data will be real-world data, such as NYC citibike data collected in August 2019.The purpose of the analysis is to find some answers to those questions; Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? Which stations are most popular and top starting and ending locations? How many rides will take place in August 2019, and who are the user types? Trips by gender and by weekday.

## Results

According to the data and its analysis, 2,344,224 rides took place in August 2019. When it comes to customer types, 81% are regular customers, which are people who have a 24-hour pass or a 3-day pass. 19% of the user type are subscribers, which means the people who have an annual membership. When looking at the peak hours, it is clear that the rush hour for riding bikes was between 5 and 6 p.m.

First, the maps below show the ride volume according to starting and ending locations. There is a vast similarity between them. I believe the reason is that the area south west of Central Park has too many facilities, resulting in too many commutes in that area.When looking at the patterns on those maps, they illustrate that, in general,starting and ending commutes take place at the same nodes.

Second, the line graphs below illustrate the checkout times for users and by gender. According to the graph of user checkout times, approximately 150K bikes have a 5 minute trip duration.Furthermore, the checkout times by gender revealed that the majority of males have short trip durations, whereas males have more trips than women.

## Summary

The heatmap of trips by weekday per hour reveals that there are a lot of people riding bikes between 8-9 a.m. and 5-6 p.m. Monday through Friday. In addition, the trips by gender show the similar pattern for male users. As a result, men are the ones who rent the most bikes.

As it can be seen below, the user trips by gender by weekday indicated that Monda to Tuesday and Thursday to Friday in terms of male users have the most bikes.
